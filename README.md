You might ask yourself: Is it possible to predict the weather? What will it be like tomorrow in Nagaland? What clothing do I need? Weather can be predicted when looking at historical data and also with the help of data science. The idea behind data science is to create models that can predict the weather for other days, weeks or even months. For example, in the case of weather, you can train a model to predict the weather for tomorrow by looking at data from the past. This model will show the best weather for tomorrow. It’s not always correct, but it’s a pretty good option. Northeastern states of India are considered as a place of varied weather conditions ranging from snow, rain, storms, etc. A group of researchers from Guwahati tried to acquire the daily weather data from various sensors that are managed by a research organization. The researchers were interested in prediction of tremendous change in the nature of weather and their impact on the environment.
